## Introduction
This is a code respository for a todo list application. 

Make a customer todo by simply adding / and the name of your customer todo to the url and press enter. 

Remove a list item by simply clicking on the name of the list item. A line strikes through and the item is immediately removed from the list.

Setup:
- run '''npm i & npm start''' on the server side to start the development server
